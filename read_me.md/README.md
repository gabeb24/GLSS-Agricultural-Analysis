This repository includes my final project for MSBA 5112 (Stats for Business Analytics) at Seattle University. For this project we were challenged with determining if household education levels and community characteristics effect agricultural profits in Ghana, using the Ghana Living Standard Survey 4 from 1998-1999. This was my first collaborative project using R Studio and GitHub, so naturally getting over the initial hump of establishing file and branch structure took time, but eventually turned out uncluttered. Although there are a few things I would like to change with this project, I am thoroughly pleased with the finished product and enjoyed overcoming the many obstacles that came with it!
